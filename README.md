> **Luma** is a *lightweight, flexible* CSS framework

#### Lightweight

No styles or components you will never use, no unnecessary weight. Luma’s size is merely **8kb gzipped**. No additional dependencies. There is no unwanted bloat that comes with the larger frameworks. By default, Luma only ships with the most used components.
